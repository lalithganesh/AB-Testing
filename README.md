# AB Testing new webpage of an e-commerce site

This project was done as a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree .

# Introduction
In this project, I try to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The main goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page,
 keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Tools Used
- Jypyter Notebooks - Environment used for the project
- Python - Programming language in which the analysis was done
- Python libraries :
  - Numpy and Pandas for Data Wrangling
  - random to generate random numbers
  - Matplotlib for Data Visualization
  - stats library for z test and regression
- Data was gathered from a csv file

# Summary of Findings
- On AB testing, we find we have statistical evidence to conclude that we fail to reject the null hypothesis 
that the old_page gets better or equal conversion rate than the new page.
